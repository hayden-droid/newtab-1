# new tab page with mascots

this is my new tab page. it's simple and easy to modify. There's also a handy countdown timer to the chuunibyou: take on me movie release date. that's important, but you can change it to something of equal importance, or get rid of it. but then you won't have a handy timer to remind you to be hyped.

add mascots in the mascots folder, and update `mascots.js` with a list of them. maybe if you are boring you can remove the mascots, but I don't know why you'd want to do that
